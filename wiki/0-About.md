# Ufront Example series: "Hello, world!"

## About

This "Hello, world!" project is part of a series of examples developed to help demistify [UFront](https://github.com/ufront/ufront) - a MVC framework for web development. Ufront is currently maintained by [Jason O'Neil](https://github.com/jasononeil).

The project uses UFront version 1.0.0-rc.6, which was the latest version available on haxelib at the time of writing.

The source code in the repository is the end result of the steps described in this wiki.
